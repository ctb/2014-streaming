\title{Streaming approaches to error detection and trimming in the analysis of
short sequencing reads}
\author{TBD}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

K-mer spectral analysis is a powerful approach to error detection and
correction in shotgun sequencing data that uses k-mer abundances to
determine likely errors (cite Pevzner, Quake, khmer-counting paper).
Approaches derived from spectral analysis can be very accurate: Zhang
et al. (2014) show that spectral analysis is considerably more
effective at finding errors than quality-based approaches (cite).
However, spectral analysis is also very compute intensive; most
implementations must count k-mers across entire sequencing data sets,
which can be memory- or I/O-intensive for large data sets.

Streaming algorithms can offer improved algorithmic and computational
efficiency in the analysis of large data sets (cite).  Streaming
algorithms typically examine the data only once, and have memory usage
that scales sublinearly with the size of the input data.  Streaming
algorithms have not been applied to k-mer spectral analysis of
sequencing reads, although Melsted et al. developed an effective
streaming algorithm for calculating aggregate statistics of k-mer
distributions from sequencing data.

Brown et al. (2012) introduced a streaming algorithm for downsampling
read data sets to normalize read coverage spectra, termed ``digital
normalization'' (abbreviated as ``diginorm'').  This procedure
estimates the k-mer coverage of each read in an online algorithm,
calculating the median k-mer abundance of the read given all previous
reads; reads above a certain estimated coverage are set aside and
their k-mers are not tracked.  The diginorm algorithm only examines
the data once, and counts only the k-mers in retained reads, leading
to sublinear memory usage for high-coverage data sets.

Here we develop a streaming algorithm for k-mer spectral analysis,
based on digital normalization, that can detect and remove errors in
sequencing reads.  This algorithm operates in sublinear memory, and
examines the data at most twice.  The approach offers a general
framework for streaming sequence analysis and could potentially be
used for error correction and variant calling.  Moreover, the approach
can be applied to data sets with variable coverage such as
transcriptomes, metagenomes, and amplified genomic DNA.  We also
describe and implement an algorithm for estimating per-position
sequencing error rates that operates in sublinear time and memory with
respect to the input data.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Coverage-normalized data can be used to locate
and correct errors in high-coverage shotgun sequencing data}

Our initial question was whether we could apply spectral error analysis
to genomic short read data after digital normalization.  We
tested this on a synthetic data set and an {\em E. coli} data set.  We
then compared the performance of Quake on the original and digitally
normalized counts from the {\em E. coli data}.

\paragraph{Simulated data:}
We first applied digital normalization to a simulated data set with
known errors.  We generated the synthetic data set from a simulated
low-complexity genome (``simple genome''; see Methods for generation
and Table~\ref{tab:data} for data set details). We then applied
digital normalization to these synthetic reads, normalizing to a
median 20-mer coverage of 20 (k=20, C=20).

The k-mer spectrum before and after digital normalization is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}.  While the total number of k-mers decreased
in the digitally normalized data set, the separation between the high
count k-mers and the low-count k-mers remains clear.  The key concept
underlying k-mer spectral error analysis is that in a high-coverage
data set, these high count k-mers will represent {\em correct} k-mers,
while the low count k-mers are produced by errors in the reads.
Simple classification methods suffice to identify and trim or correct
these low-count k-mers.

  and after digital normalization.  The peaks at 1 represents
  erroneous k-mers resulting from (simulated) error; the peaks

  present in the genome, which are shared among many reads.}

We next used k-mer counts from the downsampled read set to detect
errors in the original read set.  The algorithm is straightforward: we
look for bases at the beginning or ends of low-abundance runs of
k-mers in each read, which should signify the locations of errors. We
used a ``trusted k-mer'' cutoff of $C_0 = 3$ as our abundance cutoff,
below which we assumed k-mers were erroneous (see Methods).  The
results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:a}.  Of the 531 simulated
reads from the simple genome containing one or more errors, predicted
errors matched the known truth exactly for 443 of them (true
positives), and 466 reads were correctly predicted to contain no
errors (true negatives). 0 reads were falsely predicted to have no
errors (false negatives). The errors in 88 reads were miscalled --
while the reads each had one or more errors, the positions were not
correctly called -- and three reads were incorrectly predicted to
contain errors, leading to a total of 91 false positives.  From this,
we calculated the prediction sensitivity to be 100\% and the
prediction specificity to be 83.0\%.

\paragraph{{\em E. coli} reads:}
We next applied digital normalization and k-mer spectral error
detection to an Illumina data set from {\em E. coli} MG1655 (cite
Chitsaz).  In real reads, we do not know the location of errors; to
calculate likely errors, we mapped 5m untrimmed reads to the known {\em
  E. coli} MG1655 genome with bowtie2 (cite) and recorded mismatches
between the reads and the genome.  These mismatches were taken to be
errors in the reads.  We found 8.0m errors in 2.2m reads, for an
overall error rate of 1.60\%.

We then compared the results of k-mer spectral error detection with
and without digital normalization.  We used the same parameters as on
the simulated genome ($C_0=10$ for unnormalized, $C_0=3$ for
normalized).  The results are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:ecoli_dn_counts}. Using the original counts, the
sensitivities were close between the unnormalized and normalized
predictions: using the original counts, we achieved a sensitivity of
99.8\%, versus 99.4\% using the counts from the digitally normalized
reads.  The specificities were also comparable -- 47.9\% using the original
counts, and 47.5\% using the digitally normalized counts.

\label{tab:quake_ecoli}
\end{table}

While the results above suggest that simple spectral error detection
works equally well both before and after digital normalization, we
were concerned that we might lose informative reads and k-mers during
digital normalization.  To evaluate this, we used Quake to perform
error correction on the data set using the k-mer counts from the
digitally normalized reads, and compared the results to error
correction with the entire read data set.

The results of running Quake on the original data using counts from
the original and digitally normalized data are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:quake_ecoli}.  The performance was essentially the
same: Quake brought the overall error rate in the data set from 1.60\%
(8.0m errors) to 0.005\%-0.006\% (23,000 - 29,000 errors).

These results demonstrate that digitally normalized counts retain all
of the information necessary for effective error correction with
Quake, despite there being many fewer distinct k-mers
(Table~\ref{tab:kmer_counts}).

\subsection{Coverage-normalized data can be used to locate errors in variable
coverage shotgun sequencing data}

Digital normalization works on genomic data, with even coverage, as
well as on variable coverage data such as transcriptome and metagenome
data (cite diginorm, elijah).  One of the drawbacks of
spectral abundance analysis is that it does not directly apply to data
with variable coverage.  For example, metagenomic or transcriptomic data
sets typically contain reads from both high-abundance and
low-abundance molecules.  This in turn leads to high coverage and low
coverage reads in the same data set. This variability in coverage
confounds naive spectral analysis for two reasons: first, erroneous
k-mers from very high abundance regions can accumulate and increase in
abundance over the threshold for trusted k-mers, thus appearing to be
correct; and second, correct reads from low coverage regions yield
k-mers below the trusted k-mer threshold that appear to be incorrect.
In practice, therefore, error analysis for metagenomic and
transcriptome data uses other approaches than direct spectral error
analysis (cite).

Digital normalization uses a reference-free {\em estimator} of
per-read coverage, the median k-mer abundance within a read.  Using
this estimator, we developed a general approach that enables spectral
error analysis on variable coverage data.  We then applied this to two
synthetic data sets as well as two real data sets, a mock shotgun
metagenome and mRNAseq data from mouse.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{./figures/coverage-aware-spectrum}}
\caption{{\bf Coverage-normalized spectral error analysis.  Reads are
    normalized, and high-coverage reads are subjected to spectral
    error analysis with the normalized counts, while low-coverage
    reads are ignored.}}
\label{fig:covaware}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Coverage-normalized spectral error analysis:}

Using digital normalization, we should be able to address both the
problem of {\em too high} coverage and {\em too low} coverage.
First, by applying digital normalization to variable
coverage data and then working only with the k-mer counts from the
normalized reads, we can avoid counting high abundance errors.
Second, by ignoring reads with a low estimated coverage, we can
avoid misclassifying true low-abundance k-mers.  The process
is shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:covaware}.

% @graph with read abundance spectrum, showing which reads we will
% call errors in.

\paragraph{Simulated data:}
To test this approach, we generated two more synthetic data sets,
``simple metagenome'' and ``simple mRNAseq,'' which contain both high-
and low-abundance species (see Table~\ref{tab:data} for data set
details).  After generating synthetic reads with a 1\% error rate and
applying digital normalization (k=20/C=20), we again used the normalized
counts to do spectral error detection.  However, we used a modified
algorithm that only examined reads with a median k-mer abundance of C
or greater.

The results of running error detection on the synthetic metagenome and
mRNAseq data sets are shown in Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable}. For the
simple metagenome data set, 2254 of 2347 reads (96.0\%) met the
coverage criterion.  Of the 2254 reads analyzed, the errors in 978
erroneous reads were called perfectly (TP) and 1098 of the reads with
no errors were correctly called as error-free (TN).  Only 2 reads were
incorrectly determined to be error free (FN).  Of the remaining 176
reads, 170 were miscalled (errors existed but were not exactly called)
and 6 were incorrectly called as erroneous when they were in fact
correct.  We calculated the prediction sensitivity to be 99.9\% and
the prediction specificity to be 84.7\%.  For the simple mRNAseq data
set, 524 of 568 reads (92.3\%) met the coverage criterion, with 228
true positives, 235 true negatives, 0 false negatives, and 61 false
positives, for a prediction sensitivity of 100.0\% and prediction
specificity of 78.9\%.  In neither case were low-coverage reads
included in the statistics.

Importantly, these results are comparable to the results on the
synthetic genome (100.0\% sensitivity and 83.0\% specificity with the
same parameters; see Table~\ref{tab:a}).

\paragraph{mRNAseq data:}

% rseq_compare2.txt

To evaluate coverage-normalized spectral analysis on real data, we
applied variable coverage spectral error analysis to 1m mouse mRNAseq
reads (cite Trinity).  After calling errors in the reads by mapping
them back to the known genomes, we used spectral analysis to identify
putative errors.  The results are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable_real}, third column.  We achieved
92.9\% sensitivity and 80.7\% specificity on the 340,000 high coverage
reads in this data set.

\paragraph{Mock metagenome data:}

% podar_compare2.txt

We next applied our approach to 5m reads from a diverse mock community
data set (Shakya et al., 2013). We used a coverage threshold of 10 for
digital normalization, and found that 404,896 reads were at or above
this coverage threshold.  Here errors were again calculated by mapping
the reads to the known reference and finding mismatches.  The results
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable_real}, second column.  We
achieve 90.5\% sensitivity and 41.4\% specificity on the high coverage
reads; here, the poor specificity is probably due to the modified coverage
cutoff needed for this low coverage subset of the high diversity
mock metagenome (discussed below).

\paragraph{Error correcting variable coverage data with Quake:}

% rseq_compare6.txt

There are many sophisticated error correction algorithms implemented
for shotgun genome data, but relatively few work directly on variable
coverage data such as mRNAseq.  Digital normalization, in theory,
enables the use of {\em any} genomic error correction algorithm on the
high coverage components of data sets.

To evaluate this, we used Quake (a genomic error corrector) to correct
the high coverage mRNAseq reads using the diginorm counts.  We first
extracted the 260,641 reads with estimated coverage greater than or
equal to 20 from the mouse mRNAseq data set, and then digitally
normalized the data.  We next applied the Quake error corrector to the
unnormalized high-coverage reads using the k-mer counts from the
normalized reads, as with the {\em E. coli} data set.  Quake discarded
23,606 reads and corrected the remainder.

\label{tab:quake_mrna}
\end{table}

We evaluated the corrected reads by mapping them against the mouse
transcriptome, and found that, for the retained reads, Quake reduced
the overall error rate from 1.28\% (230,125 mismatches in 18,012,456
bp total) to 0.43\% (74,797 in 17,254,585 total) - see
Table~\ref{tab:quake_mrna}.  As with {\em E. coli}, this suggests that
sufficient information remains in the digitally normalized data to do
an effective job of error correction.

\subsection{A streaming algorithm for error analysis}

The spectral error detection approach outlined above is a 2-pass
offline algorithm for any given data set - the first pass normalizes
the read set and records the k-mer abundances, while the second pass
analyzes the reads for low-abundance k-mers.  Even with digital
normalization reducing the number of k-mers under consideration, this
2-pass approach is time consuming on large data sets.  Below, we
develop a general streaming approach that considers many of the
reads only once.

\paragraph{Streaming analysis of coverage-saturated regions:}

Shotgun sequencing oversamples most regions -- for example, for a 100x
coverage genomic data set, we would expect 50\% or more of the genome
to be represented by more than 100 reads.  This is a consequence of
the Poisson-random sampling that underlies shotgun sequencing (cite
Waterman?).  This oversampling provides an opportunity, however: if we
regard the read data set as a stream of incoming data randomly sampled
from a pool of molecules, high-abundance species or subsequences
within the pool will be more highly sampled in the stream than others,
and will thus generally appear earlier in the stream.  For example, in
mRNAseq, highly expressed transcripts will on average be highly
sampled much more frequently than low-expressed transcripts, and more
reads from highly expressed transcripts will be seen in any given
subset.

We can adapt the same approaches used in previous sections to do {\em
  streaming} error analysis by detecting and analyzing high-coverage
reads {\em during} the first pass.  Here we again use the median k-mer
abundance within a read to estimate read coverage (cite diginorm);
crucially, this can be done at any point in a stream, by using the
online k-mer counting functionality of khmer to determine the
abundance of k-mers seen thus far in the stream (cite khmer-counting).

The conceptual idea is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:concept}.  On the
first pass, low-coverage reads would be incorporated into the k-mer
database and set aside for later analysis, while high-coverage reads
would be analyzed for errors. On the second pass, the set aside reads
would be checked for coverage again, and either ignored or analyzed
for errors.  Crucially, this second pass involves {\em at most}
another full pass across the data, but only when the entire data set
is below the coverage threshold; the larger the high coverage
component of the data, the smaller the fraction of the data that is
examined twice.

In Figure~\ref{fig:saturation}, we show diginorm-generated coverage

hence can be used for error analysis on the first pass through the

Moreover, because only the normalized counts are used in spectral
analysis, the approach should apply equally well to data sets with
uneven coverage, i.e. metagenomes and transcriptomes.  To test this,
we first apply this streaming error detection approach to the three
synthetic data sets used earlier, and then to the three real data
sets.

\paragraph{Streaming error analysis of synthetic data:}

Using the streaming approach on the ``simple genome'' reads, we obtain
nearly identical numbers to the full two-pass approach: 485 TP, 365
TN, 150 FP, and 0 FN, for a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of
76.3\% (Table~\ref{tab:spectra_streaming}).  However, with the
streaming algorithm, only 320 of the 1000 reads are examined twice.
Likewise, for the ``simple mRNAseq'' and ``simple metagenome'' data
sets, we obtain identical and nearly identical results, respectively;
due to differences in the order in which reads are examined, the
simple metagenome fails to detect one true positive and erroneously
finds errors in three extra reads.  On the mRNAseq data set, 33.1\% of
the reads are examined twice, and on the metagenome, 380 of 2347
(16.2\%) of the reads are examined twice.

We also get similar quality results on the real data sets when
comparing two-pass error detection with streaming error detection
(Table~\ref{tab:spectra_streaming_real}).  For {\em E. coli}, with
streaming error detection we obtain a sensitivity of 99.5\% and a
specificity of 47.6\%, compared to 99.8\% and 47.9\% with the two-pass
approach (Table~\ref{tab:ecoli_dn_counts}).  For the mock metagenome,
we have a sensitivity of 90.6\% with streaming, vs 90.5\% with the
two-pass approach; and a specificity of 30.0\% with streaming, vs
31.4\% with the two pass approach (compare
Table~\ref{tab:spectra_streaming_real} and
Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable_real}).  And for the mRNAseq data set,
we see a sensitivity of 93.3\% with streaming vs 92.9\% with two-pass,
and a specificity of 80.2\% vs 80.7\% for streaming vs two-pass,
respectively.  However, the streaming
approach examined the {\em E. coli} reads only XX times, the
metagenome reads YY times, and the mRNAseq reads ZZ times on average.

\subsection{A streaming algorithm for error trimming}

Once errors can be {\em detected} with a streaming algorithm, errors
can also be {\em removed} by trimming reads at the first base
predicted to be erroneous in a read.  This approach is remarkably
effective, but can require considerably more memory than quality-score
based trimming (cite khmer counting).  Moreover, it is currently
implemented as an offline algorithm.  Below, we apply the same
streaming approach shown in Figure~\ref{fig:concept} to trimming
reads.

%  (While it is possible to split reads around errors
%rather than truncating them, this introduces complications in
% downstream read processing.)

% make compare5

\paragraph{Streaming error trimming on synthetic data:}

On the ``simple genome'' with counts from the digitally normalized
reads, this trimming approach eliminates 149 reads entirely and
truncates another 392 reads.  Of the 100,000 bp in the simulated
reads, 31,910 (31.9\%) were removed by the trimming process.  In
exchange, trimming eliminated {\em all} of the errors, bringing the
overall error rate from 0.63\% to 0.00\%.

% make mcompare5
% make rcompare5

For the simple metagenome we used the variable abundance approach
described above and only trimmed reads with estimated coverage of 20
or higher.  Here, of 2347 reads containing 234,700 bp, 314 reads
(13.4\%) were removed and 851 reads (36.3\%) were trimmed, discarding
a total of 74,321 bases (31.7\%).  Of 1451 errors total, all but 61
were eliminated, bringing the overall per-base error rate from 0.62\% to
0.04\%.  The simple mRNAseq data set showed similar improvement: 83 of
568 reads were removed, and 208 were trimmed, removing 19,507 of
56,800 bases (34.34\%).  The initial error rate was 0.65\% and the
final error rate was 0.07\%.

most of the reads in this data set.  XXX

%With Illumina sequencing, average and per-position error rates may
%vary between sequencing runs, but are typically systematic within a
%run (cite?).  Per-position error rates are caused by fluidics etc.
%Ability to estimate and evaluate is good.

K-mer spectral error analysis can also be used to calculate
per-position relative sequencing error for entire data sets (cite
khmer-counting).  We can adapt the streaming approaches above to
efficiently provide estimates for {\em subsets} of the data.  The
basic idea is to consume reads until sufficient data has been
collected to calculate error rates, and then to calculate error rates
for new reads based on the k-mer abundances from the consumed reads.
This can be done in one pass for data sets with sufficiently high
coverage data: as shown above (Figure~\ref{fig:saturation}), in some
data sets, most of the reads will have sufficient coverage to call
errors by the time 20\% of the data set has been consumed.

Using the same error detection code as above, we implemented a
sublinear memory/sublinear time algorithm that collects reads until
some regions have reached 20x coverage, or 200,000 reads have
surpassed a coverage of 10x (see Methods for details).  In either
case, all reads at or above a coverage of 10 are analyzed for errors,
with a trusted k-mer cutoff of 3.  In Figure~\ref{fig:ecoli_err} and
Figure~\ref{fig:rseq_err} we show the resulting error profiles for the
{\em E. coli} and mouse RNAseq data sets, compared with the profile
obtained by examining the locations of mismatches to the references.
We also show the error profile obtained with the full two-pass approach
(using digital normalization and then error detection as in section XXX)
for comparison.

In the {\em E. coli} data set (Figure~\ref{fig:ecoli_err}), we see the
increase in error rate towards the 3' end of the gene that is
characteristic of Illumina sequencing (cite).  All three error
profiles agree in shape (Pearson's correlation of 0.99 between each
pair) although they are offset considerably in absolute magnitude.
The k-mer error profile was calculated from the first XXX reads, but
is consistent across five other subsets of the data chosen randomly
with reservoir sampling (data not shown); all five subsets had
Pearson's correlation coefficients greater than 0.99 with the
bowtie2 mapping profile and the two-pass spectral approach.

The RNAseq error profile exhibits two large spikes, one at position 34
and one at position 69.  Both spikes appear to be genuine and
correlate with large numbers of Ns in those positions in the original
data set.  The spikes are present in the profiles derived from
two-pass spectral analysis as well as the bowtie2 mismatch
calculation.  However, the sublinear approach does not detect them
when using the first YYY reads.  This is because of the choice of
subsample: five other subsamples, chosen randomly from the entire data
set with reservoir sampling, match the match the two-pass spectral
analysis (data not shown).  The error profiles calculated from all six
subsamples with the sublinear algorithm have a Pearson's correlation
coefficient greater than 0.96 with the error profiles from the full
two-pass spectral approach and the bowtie2 mismatches.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Digital normalization can be applied effectively to short reads prior to error detection and correction.}

Tracking k-mer abundances in large short-read data sets is part of
many error detection and correction algorithms, but this process can
be time and memory intensive.  Our results demonstrate that digital
normalization can be used to reduce the total number of k-mers under
consideration, without strongly affecting performance.  We showed
this in both simulated and real data.

With a real {\em E. coli} data set, digital normalization reduced the
number of k-mers by a third (Table~\ref{tab:ecoli_dn_counts}, Distinct
k-mers) yielding essentially the same sensitivity and specificity of
error predictions.  Moreover, when we ran the Quake error corrector on
the reads using unnormalized and normalized counts
(Table~\ref{tab:quake_ecoli}), we achieved nearly identical results,
demonstrating that the digital normalized data sets retain all of the
information necessary for error correction.

\subsection{K-mer counts from digitally normalized short reads can be used to error correct mRNAseq and metagenome data}

Spectral error correction approaches typically rely on assumptions of
uniform sequence coverage, but these assumptions are violated by
several types of data, including mRNAseq and shotgun metagenome data.
Digital normalization evens out this coverage, allowing existing
spectral error correction approaches to be applied to data from
samples with non-uniform abundances.  We demonstrated this by using
spectral error detection with digitally normalized data to predict
errors in both synthetic and real RNAseq and metagenome data
(Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable_real}).  We then again used Quake to
error correct high-coverage portions of mRNAseq and shotgun metagenome
data sets, which yielded good results (Table~\ref{tab:quake_mrna}).
This again demonstrates that digitally normalized data retains the
information necessary to error correct high coverage reads.

We believe this is a general approach that could allow any error
correction software that separates k-mer counting from error
correction to be applied to mRNAseq, shotgun metagenome, and
whole-genome amplified samples.

% err corr, e.g. Lighter?)

\subsection{Short-read error detection and trimming can be done efficiently with a streaming few-pass sublinear-memory algorithm}

K-mer spectral error detection, trimming, and correction approaches
are typically implemented as a two-pass offline algorithm, in which
k-mer counts are collected in a first pass and then reads are
corrected in a second pass.  While several algorithms that run in sub
linear memory do exist (e.g. Lighter), these are still offline
algorithms that require at least two full passes across the data.  In
high coverage data sets it is possible, however, to detect reads that
are high coverage in the context of previously encountered reads.  By
integrating k-mer spectral error analysis directly into the digital
normalization algorithm, we showed that on both synthetic and real
data sets, we achieved nearly identical predictions to the full
two-pass algorithm with an algorithm that is less than two pass
(compare Table~\ref{tab:spectra_variable_real} to
Table~\ref{tab:spectra_streaming_real}).

We also adapted the error detection algorithm to do streaming error
trimming on genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic data.  On high
coverage components of variable coverage data sets, this led to
a substantial decrease in errors - up to an order of magnitude.
(XXX Talk about large, real data sets - Sherine work.)

\subsection{Data-set wide error profiles can be calculated in sub linear time and memory}

The ability to analyze high-coverage reads without examining the
entire data set offers some intriguing possibilities.  One concrete
application is the use of high coverage reads to infer data-set wide
error characteristics for shotgun data, in a way that is robust to the
sample.  Can also be used to assess whether the necessary coverage has
been obtained in order to truncate sequencing, in e.g. metagenomics
workflows.

More generally, the approach of using saturating coverage to truncate
computational analysis may have application to streaming sequencing
technologies such as Nanopore, where realtime feedback between
sequencing and sequence analysis could be useful.

\subsection{Concluding thoughts}

We describe time- and memory- efficient general algorithmic approaches
to k-mer spectral error detection and correction based on read-local
analysis of coverage.

These approaches can be applied to variable coverage data, including
mRNAseq and shotgun metagenome reads.

Future applications include streaming error correction, reference-free
variant calling, and reference-free analysis of streaming sequencing
data.
