	Abstract = {Analysis of biological data often involves large data sets and computationally expensive algorithms. Databases of biological data continue to grow, leading to an increasing demand for improved algorithms and data structures. Despite having many advantages over more traditional indexing structures, the Bloom filter is almost unused in bioinformatics. Here we present a robust and efficient Bloom filter implementation in Haskell, and implement a simple bioinformatics application for indexing and matching sequence data. We use this to index the chromosomes that make up the human genome, and map all available gene sequences to it. Our experiences with developing and tuning our application suggest that for bioinformatics applications, Haskell offers a compelling combination of rapid development, quality assurance, and high performance.},

	Abstract = {A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient randomized data structure allowing membership queries over sets with certain allowable errors. It is widely used in many applications which take advantage of its ability to compactly represent a set, and filter out effectively any element that does not belong to the set, with small error probability. This paper introduces the Spectral Bloom Filter (SBF), an extension of the original Bloom Filter to multi-sets, allowing the filtering of elements whose multiplicities are below a threshold given at query time. Using memory only slightly larger than that of the original Bloom Filter, the SBF supports queries on the multiplicities of individual keys with a guaranteed, small error probability. The SBF also supports insertions and deletions over the data set. We present novel methods for reducing the probability and magnitude of errors. We also present an efficient data structure and algorithms to build it incrementally and maintain it over streaming data, as well as over materialized data with arbitrary insertions and deletions. The SBF does not assume any a priori filtering threshold and effectively and efficiently maintains information over the entire data-set, allowing for ad-hoc queries with arbitrary parameters and enabling a range of new applications.},

	Abstract = {Accurate network traffic measurement is required for accounting, bandwidth provisioning and detecting DoS attacks. These applications see the traffic as a collection of flows they need to measure. As link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping a counter for each flow is too expensive (using SRAM) or slow (using DRAM). The current state-of-the-art methods (Cisco's sampled NetFlow) which log periodically sampled packets are slow, inaccurate and resource-intensive. Previous work showed that at different granularities a small number of heavy hitters accounts for a large share of traffic. Our paper introduces a paradigm shift for measurement by concentrating only on large flows --- those above some threshold such as 0.1% of the link capacity.We propose two novel and scalable algorithms for identifying the large flows: sample and hold and multistage filters, which take a constant number of memory references per packet and use a small amount of memory. If $M$ is the available memory, we show analytically that the errors of our new algorithms are proportional to $1/M$; by contrast, the error of an algorithm based on classical sampling is proportional to $1/sqrtM$, thus providing much less accuracy for the same amount of memory. We also describe further optimizations such as early removal and conservative update that further improve the accuracy of our algorithms, as measured on real traffic traces, by an order of magnitude. Our schemes allow a new form of accounting called threshold accounting in which only flows above a threshold are charged by usage while the rest are charged a fixed fee. Threshold accounting generalizes usage-based and duration based pricing.},

@article{Audano2014,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Converting nucleotide sequences into short overlapping fragments of uniform length, k-mers, is a common step in many bioinformatics applications. While existing software packages count k-mers, few are optimized for speed, offer an API (Application Programming Interface), a graphical interface, or contain features that make it extensible and maintainable. We designed KAnalyze to compete with the fastest k-mer counters, to produce reliable output, and to support future development efforts through well architected, documented, and testable code. Currently, KAnalyze can output k-mer counts in a sorted tab-delimited file or stream k-mers as they are read. KAnalyze can process large data sets with 2GB of memory. This project is implemented in Java 7, and the CLI (Command Line Interface) is designed to integrate into pipelines written in any language.
RESULTS: As a k-mer counter, KAnalyze outperforms Jellyfish (Mar{\c c}ais and Kingsford, 2011), DSK (Rizk et al., 2013), and a pipeline built on a Perl and Linux utilities. Through extensive unit and system testing, we have verified that KAnalyze produces the correct k-mer counts over multiple data sets and k-mer sizes.
AVAILABILITY: KAnalyze is available on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/kanalyze/ SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

@article{Roy2014,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Counting the frequencies of k-mers in read libraries is often a first step in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. Infrequent k-mers are assumed to be a result of sequencing errors. The frequent k-mers constitute a reduced but error-free representation of the experiment, which can inform read error correction or serve as the input to de novo assembly methods. Ideally, the memory requirement for counting should be linear in the number of frequent k-mers and not in the, typically much larger, total number of k-mers in the read library.
RESULTS: We present a novel method that balances time, space and accuracy requirements to efficiently extract frequent k-mers even for high-coverage libraries and large genomes such as human. Our method is designed to minimize cache misses in a cache-efficient manner by using a pattern-blocked Bloom filter to remove infrequent k-mers from consideration in combination with a novel sort-and-compact scheme, instead of a hash, for the actual counting. Although this increases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the empirical running times. A variant of method can resort to a counting Bloom filter for even larger savings in memory at the expense of false-negative rates in addition to the false-positive rates common to all Bloom filter-based approaches. A comparison with the state-of-the-art shows reduced memory requirements and running times.

@article{Howe2014,
	Abstract = {The large volumes of sequencing data required to sample deeply the microbial communities of complex environments pose new challenges to sequence analysis. De novo metagenomic assembly effectively reduces the total amount of data to be analyzed but requires substantial computational resources. We combine two preassembly filtering approaches-digital normalization and partitioning-to generate previously intractable large metagenome assemblies. Using a human-gut mock community dataset, we demonstrate that these methods result in assemblies nearly identical to assemblies from unprocessed data. We then assemble two large soil metagenomes totaling 398 billion bp (equivalent to 88,000 Escherichia coli genomes) from matched Iowa corn and native prairie soils. The resulting assembled contigs could be used to identify molecular interactions and reaction networks of known metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology database. Nonetheless, more than 60% of predicted proteins in assemblies could not be annotated against known databases. Many of these unknown proteins were abundant in both corn and prairie soils, highlighting the benefits of assembly for the discovery and characterization of novelty in soil biodiversity. Moreover, 80% of the sequencing data could not be assembled because of low coverage, suggesting that considerably more sequencing data are needed to characterize the functional content of soil.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome assembly tools based on the de Bruijn graph framework rely on a parameter k, which represents a trade-off between several competing effects that are difficult to quantify. There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.
RESULTS: We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.
